This extension study examines (1) whether European populist leaders compromise on European economic integration and (2) if economic factors contribute to their longer tenure in office. For this purpose, the results and methods from Funke et al. (2020) were critically assessed. Applying the synthetic control method (SCM), the authors explain the surge of populist leaders with the cultural backlash argumentation, while neglecting any potential economic reasons for their re-election. Furthermore, this paper proposes and conducts an iterative two-stage synthetic counterfactual approach taking the case of unemployment in Hungary. First the predictor weights are determined based on panel regression results. Second the optimal donor weights are determined based on the estimated predictor weights. It was found that (1) trade and financial openness decrease under right-wing populist policies leading to economic disintegration. The advanced SCM-Analysis shows that (2) shortly after his election in 2010, Victor Orb√°n implemented policies that lead to a decrease in the unemployment rate. This is in line with Algan et al. (2017), who do not explain European populism solely with the cultural backlash theory but argue that economic uncertainty plays an important role.
